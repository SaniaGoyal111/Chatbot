# Chatbot
Just for learning
This basic medical chatbot is designed to provide information, guidance, and awareness about Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). It helps users understand the condition, recognize early symptoms, and learn about risk factors, lifestyle management, and when to consult a doctor.
This chatbot is educational, not a replacement for medical advice, and is ideal for individuals looking to learn more about CKD or manage their condition better through basic guidance.
This is what I learnt to just start with making of a chabot, to see how it works and It just answer on the basis of what is in the article so there is a big scope of improvement I hope I will be able to come with an improved version of this bot. We can integrate AI for personalized advice based on user inputs, Supporting multiple languages for wider accessibility, Developing a mobile-friendly version or app integration, Connecting with healthcare providers for appointment booking or referrals and many more to do.
